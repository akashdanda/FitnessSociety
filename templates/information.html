        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>The goal of this website is to inspire the youth to become more physically active. 
            This is a social media based fitness website where users can make friends, record their own progress, and see their friendsâ€™ progress. 
            Around 20 percent of adolescents are obese and this affects around 15 million children in America. 
            Obesity can lead to severe health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and strokes. 
            Over the years, more children are obese now than ever before.
